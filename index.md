# Welcome!

Let's explore the key concepts of Bachata Musicality.

Since my own journey learning the dance Bachata began, I was told to "feel the music". In my eyes this was a concept I didn't understand easily.

At this time, Bachata dancing was introduced through the music and basic rhythms of Bachata primarily by listening to the Bong√≥s whilst learning the basic steps of Bachata Moderna (Modern Bachata). Soon after, I became more familiar with the sounds of the instruments within the music ensuring I could keep time with the music. Over time, my development progressed and I was then able to embelish the musical phrases with adnornments through body movement.

This experience amongst many others enhanced my exposure so I could explore the subject of Bachata Musicality.

This guide is designed to help you to learn the concepts of Bachata Musicality in order to help you embrace and understand the music and it's particular dynamics while you dance or listen.
